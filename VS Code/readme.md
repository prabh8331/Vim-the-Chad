# Vim with VS Code

This repository is dedicated to sharing my custom VS Code settings that integrate Vim functionality.

## Why This Repository?

I wanted to learn Vim without giving up my current IDE, VS Code. Although I experimented with other editors like Zed, Geany, and Neovim, they didn't quite work for me.

Ultimately, I decided to configure VS Code to incorporate some Vim-like features while retaining the conventional VS Code experience. My goal is to increase productivity and speed, leveraging the best of both worldsâ€”Vim's efficiency and the familiarity of VS Code.
